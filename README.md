# embedded_agent
Agent guided by ACT-R model navigating through simple DodgeAsteroids environment. The environment is implemented in Python.

to start the simulation:
1) start ACT-R
2) open terminal within repository
3) run "python -i environment.py" in terminal
4) in terminal "run()" will start the simulation.

The stepper function within ACT-R can be used. The visualization is also in ACT-R. This is work in progress. It serves as a starting point for more sophisticated applications with more complex environments.
